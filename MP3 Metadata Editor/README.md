[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A Python script used for editing the information (metadata) and the image embedded in a .mp3 file.

## Usage:
Put the .mp3 file in the "merger" folder.

Optionally, also put the cover image you want to embed in the .mp3 file into the folder.

Do not put anything else into the folder, else the script will fail.

Start application with `python main.py`.
